This would work in some sense, but it would not be a very useful representation.

        "As we propagate the constraints, cells that did not use to be singletons may have become singletons.  For eample, in the above example, the center cell has become known to be a 5: we need to make sure that also these singletons are propagated. \n",
        "\n",
        "This is why we have written propagate_cell so that it returns the set of newly-singleton cells.  \n",
        "We need now to write a method `full_propagation` that at the beginning starts with a set of `to_propagate` cells (if it is not specified, then we just take it to consist of all singleton cells).  Then, it picks a cell from the to_propagate set, and propagates from it, adding any newly singleton cell to to_propagate.  Once there are no more cells to be propagated, the method returns. \n",
        "If this sounds similar to graph reachability, it is ... because it is!  It is once again the algorithmic pattern of keeping a list of work to be done, then iteratively picking an element from the list, doing it, possibly updating the list of work to be done with new work that has to be done as a result of what we just did, and continuing in this fashion until there is nothing left to do. \n",

        "Classically, this way of searching for a solution has been called search with _backtracking._\n",

For instance, it is much better to choose a cell with set $\\{1, 2\\}$ than one with set $\\{1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}$, as the probability of success is $1/2$ in the first case and $1/6$ in the second case. \n",

If we want our search for a solution to be exhaustive, as in the above Sudoku example, we ensure that we try iteratively all choices from a set of choices chosen so that at least one of them must succeed.  In the above example, we know that at least one of the digit values must be the true one, hence our search is exhaustive.  In other cases, we can trade off exhaustiveness for efficiency, and we may try only a few choices, guided perhaps by an heuristic. \n",
        "\n",
        "The _constraint propagation_ step propagates the consequences of the choice to the problem.  Each choice thus gives rise to a new problem, which is a little bit simpler than the original one as some of the possible choices, that is, some of its complexity, has been removed.  In the Sudoku case, the new problem has less indetermination, as at least one more of its cells has a known digit in it. \n",

As these problems are simpler (they contain fewer choices), eventually the recursion must reach a point where no more choice is possible, and whether constraint propagation should yield a completely defined problem, one of which it is possible to say whether it is solvable or not with a trivial test.  This forms the base case for the recursion. \n",
