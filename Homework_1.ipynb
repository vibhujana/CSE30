        "* `vote(c)`: records a vote for candidate `c`. \n",
        "* `total_votes()`: returns the total number of votes. \n",
        "* `winner()`: returns the set of candidates with maximal votes.  Normally there is only one, but there could be a tie, in which case you return the set of tied candidates.  Return `None` if no votes have been cast.\n",
        "* `margin()`: returns the margin of victory, that is, the number of votes separating the fist from the second candidate.  This can be 0, in case of a tie.  If there is only one candidate, you can answer with the number of votes for the candidate.  If no votes have been cast, return `None`. \n",
