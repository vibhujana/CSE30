        "> Bring water to a boil, and when it boils, salt it.  Put the pasta in (I like Penne Rigate).   When cooked, colander the water away, and quickly unite in the bowl the beaten eggs, the pasta, and the pancetta.  Mix well and serve immediately. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you have to invite people over, you could do this recipe sequentially, and first worry about cooking the pasta: warming the water, putting the pasta in, then colandering it.  Then you could worry about cooking the pancetta and onions.  When that's done, you can start to beat the eggs. Finally, you could unite everything.  Technically, that would work, but there would be two problems.  The first is that, of course, the pasta would be rather cold by the time it would be served, a capital sin (pasta must be served immediately after it is cooked).  Secondly, even if you rehash the order so that you first cook the pancetta, then beat the eggs, then cook the pasta, then technically this works -- but it would take you well over one hour to have everything ready.  You want to do things in parallel, cooking the pancetta while heating up the water for the pasta, and so forth.  You want to discover what are the things that need to be done one after the other, and what are the things that can be done in parallel, and in which order to do everything.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Great cooking, by the way, is much about the perfect timing, not only the perfect preparation.  You have to have the various preparations ready at the same time, to unite them just right.  We will worry about timing in the second part of this chapter; first, we worry about what we can do and in which order.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an aside for those of you who are more interested in compiling code than in cooking, the problem of how to compile C or C++ code is very similar.  A makefile defines dependencies between tasks: you have to have compiled pathlib.c before you can link the result together with something else.  The task of the make program is to figure out how to parallelize the compilation, so that independent tasks can happen in different processes (possibly on different CPU cores), while respecting the precedence constraints between tasks.  We will mention this application in some of the exercises of the chapter. \n",

The operations need to have a simple, clear definition, and be useful in a concrete implementation of the service which will run the tasks.  Of the above operations, they are all uncontroversial, except for the choice of behavior of _completed_.  In theory, there is no need for _completed_ to return the set of _new_ tasks that can now be undertaken.  If one remembers the set of tasks $T_1$ one can a do before a task $t \\in T_1$ is completed, and marks $t$ as completed, one can simply ask the scheduler for the set of tasks $T_2$ that can now be done, and add those in $T_{21t} = T_2 \\setminus (\\{t\\} \\cup T_1)$ for execution.  However, we guess (as we have not yet written the task execution engine) that being told this set of tasks directly will simplify the design of the task execution engine. "

        "#### Redoing in cooking\n",
        "\n",
        "The act of redoing a cooking step is somewhat different than the act of redoing something in code.  Suppose you cook pasta, unite with it the fried bacon and onions, and then -- terrible mishap -- you unite with it the beaten egg yolks in which one of the eggs is rotten. \n",
        "\n",
        "In code, when one file changes, you only need to redo the things that _depend_ on that file.  In cooking, it is different: even if nothing changed in the bacon, onions, and cooked pasta, once you add to it rotten eggs you have to redo the pasta, bacon, onions, etc, as well, as they have now been contaminated.  The root of the problem is that in a makefile, when you combine two files to compute a result, you do not destroy the original files, whereas in cooking, once you combine foods, you don't have the original foods any longer.  Cooking is like a makefile in which, once you combine files, you immediately delete them. \n",
        "\n",
        "So let us come up with a precise definition of what needs to be redone in cooking, when one of the steps goes bad (the eggs are rotten, you burn the food on the stove, and so on). \n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, we label _redo_ the task that needs redoing.  We then propagate the label according to these two phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 1: Forward** \n",
        "Apply the following rule as long as it can be applied: \n",
        "\n",
        "* Consider a task $v$ labeled _redo_. If $u$ is a successor of $v$ and $u$ is completed, then $u$ is also labeled _redo_. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Phase 2: Backward**\n",
        "Apply the following rule as long as it can be applied: \n",
        "\n",
        "* Consider a task $v$ labeled _redo_. If $u$ is a predecessor of $v$, then $u$ is also labeled _redo_ (note that in this case, we are guaranteed that $u$ is completed). \n",
        "\n",
        "The first rule corresponds to a _forward_ pass in the dependency garph; the second rule corresponds to a _backward_ pass in the dependency relation. \n",
        "Once the _redo_ label is propagated, all tasks that are marked _redo_ are changed from completed, to uncompleted. \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that you have to implement _once_ the forward phase, followed by _once_ the backward phase.  Example: you press some lemons, and you use a bit of the juice to make a mayonnaise, and another part to marinate shrimp.  If it turns out that the egg yolk used for the mayonnaise was rotten, you need to press a bit of lemon again, but you do not need to marinate the shrimp once more.\n",
        "\n",
        "We ask you to implement this in code."
